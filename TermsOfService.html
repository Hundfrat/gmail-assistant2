            <p class="second-text">Please note that your use of and access to our services (defined below) are subject
                to the following terms; if you do not agree to all of the following, you may not use or access the
                services in any manner.
                <br>
                <br>
                These Terms of Use (the "Terms") are a binding contract between you and Gmail Assistant ("Gmail
                Assistant", "we" and "us"). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these Terms or
                the Services, please contact us at hello@gmail-assistant.com.
                <br>
                <br>
                You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don't have the right to use the Services. Your
                using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in
                effect while you use the services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those
                in the Privacy Policy.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span> Will these Terms ever change?</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                We are constantly improving our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We
                reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by
                placing a notice on the Gmail Assistant website, and/or by sending you an email, and/or by some other
                means.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will
                no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is
                effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

                <span> Fair Usage Policy</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                Gmail Assistant is designed for individual human use. To ensure optimal service quality and equitable
                access for all premium users, we implement the following Fair Usage Policy:
                <br>
                <br>
                Query Limits: Premium accounts are allocated a specified number of smart AI or image queries per month.
                Gmail Assistant may implement rate limiting on queries that exceed typical human usage patterns.
                <br>
                <br>
                Content Volume: Queries involving large amounts of text or sizeable file attachments may require
                significant computational resources. Sudden large requests or extremely frequent queries can impact
                system performance for all users. Therefore, we implement soft limits to maintain consistent service
                quality.
                <br>
                <br>
                Human-Paced Usage: Our service is optimized for human-paced interactions. Queries at a rate exceeding
                typical human capacity may be classified as unauthorized programmatic usage.
                <br>
                <br>
                Individual Use: Gmail Assistant accounts are for individual use only. Usage patterns suggesting shared
                accounts or multiple users on a single account are prohibited.
                <br>
                <br>
                Time-based Monitoring: Usage is monitored across various time frames to ensure it aligns with expected
                patterns of individual human use.
                <br>
                <br>
                Prohibited Usage: Any attempt to access the Services through automated means, extract data, or bypass
                the official user interface is strictly prohibited. All interactions must be initiated directly through
                the Gmail Assistant user interface by an individual user.
                <br>
                <br>
                Service Adjustments: Gmail Assistant reserves the right to adjust service performance or access for
                accounts that consistently exceed normal human usage patterns or violate this Fair Usage Policy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Compliance: Violation of this Fair Usage Policy may result in temporary service limitations or, in
                severe cases, account suspension or termination.
                <br>
                <br>
                We strive to provide high-quality service to all users while managing the intensive computational
                demands of AI technology. Our Fair Usage Policy helps ensure that the actions of any single user do not
                negatively impact the experience of others or the overall system performance.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you have specific high-volume needs that may not align with typical individual use, please contact
                our sales team to discuss custom solutions tailored to your requirements.
                <br>
                <br>
                Gmail Assistant reserves the right to modify this Fair Usage Policy at any time. Continued use of our
                services following any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Fair Usage Policy.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span> Miscellaneous</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                These Terms and the relationship between you and Gmail Assistant shall be governed by the laws of the
                State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Gmail Assistant agree to
                submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Santa Clara County, California or the
                United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
                <br>
                <br>
                If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall
                be enforced to the fullest extent possible, and the remaining Terms shall remain in full force and
                effect.
                <br>
                <br>
                These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Gmail Assistant with respect to the use of
                the Services and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, understandings, and agreements,
                whether written or oral, between you and Gmail Assistant.
                <br>
                <br>
